Explanation of the Code:
Adjustable Parameters:

speed: Controls the speed of the motors (range: 0-255).
rowLength: Specifies how long the robot moves forward for each row.
turnDuration: Time required to make a 90-degree turn.
rows: Total number of rows to traverse.
Functions:

moveForward(duration): Moves the robot forward for a given duration.
moveBackward(duration): Moves the robot backward for a given duration (if needed).
turnRight(duration): Executes a 90-degree right turn by rotating one wheel forward and the other backward.
turnLeft(duration): Executes a 90-degree left turn.
stopMotors(): Stops all motor activity.
Traversal Logic:

The robot moves forward row by row.
At the end of each row (except the last), it makes a 90-degree right turn, moves slightly forward, and makes another 90-degree right turn to align with the next row.
After completing all rows, the robot stops.
How to Test and Adjust:
Field Dimensions:
Measure the actual row length and adjust rowLength accordingly.
Turn Accuracy:
Fine-tune turnDuration to achieve precise 90-degree turns.
Speed Control:
Start with a moderate speed and increase gradually for better control.
